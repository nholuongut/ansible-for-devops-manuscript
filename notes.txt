# Notes

## Publishing process

See README file inside the `ansible-for-devops publicity/Published Editions` directory.

## Editing notes:

  - Spellcheck.
  - Search for "that" in text.
  - Search for `...` in code examples and make it consistent.
  - Ensure cowsay is in every chapter summary.
  - Look through all code samples and fix line-wrapped lines.
  - Search for "â€”" (em-dash) in entire book and replace with `---`.
  - Search for "its" and "it's" and ensure proper grammatical usage.
  - Remove parentheses that are meaningless.
  - Search for 'ansible' (lower) and make sure non-CLI usage is capitalized.
  - Search for 'simple' and 'simply', since I overuse these words.
  - Search for ' can' to find uses where it's removal makes sentences stronger.
  - Search for proper names (companies, software, etc.) and make sure they're capitalized.
  - Search for ' a the' and fix those instances.
  - Search for "PLAY RECAP" and make sure code blocks are 74 lines (70 max without indent).
